# ebayScraper
a python web app for scraping ebay for search terms and outputting it as a html table

Just enter search term in input box on index.html and wait a while for the table to be generated.

This can probably be optimised for speed and efficiency but it works pretty well for what i needed it to do.


Future changes:

Sort feature

multi-search

database tracker (compare sold on dates - will be good for writing reports on trends and stuff)
